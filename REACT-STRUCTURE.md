# Frontend Structure

React is a single page application that uses components to render elements in a smart way.

## Components

We place our components in the catalog src/components/

We style our components by creating a css file with the same name as the component in the catalog src/components/css/

When we work with bigger components that represents different pages, such as 'home page', we may want to place these components in the src/pages catalog instead. This is because we want to maintain an organized structure in our project and not just dump everything into one folder.
